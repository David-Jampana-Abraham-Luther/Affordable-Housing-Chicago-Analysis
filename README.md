# Affordable-Housing-Chicago-Analysis

📌 Project Overview

We analyzed the distribution of property types, spatial housing patterns, and accessibility across Chicago’s community areas. The dataset, sourced from the City of Chicago, contains 593 records across 14 attributes related to affordable housing.

🔍 Key Insights
🏘️ Property Types
Multifamily (44%) and ARO (25%) properties dominate the affordable housing market.

Specialized demographics (e.g., Senior LGBTQ, Supportive Veterans) are significantly underrepresented.

📍 Geospatial Patterns
Affordable housing is clustered in specific community areas.

Weak correlation observed between unit counts and property types.


🏛️ Policy Implications
Identified gaps in housing availability for vulnerable groups.

Provides support for data-driven resource allocation and planning efforts.

🧠 Methods
Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, unified formats.

Exploratory Analysis: Created bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps to compare distributions and densities.

Geospatial Analysis: Used leaflet to map latitude/longitude coordinates and reveal spatial trends across Chicago.


🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Languages: R (primary), Python

Libraries:

R: leaflet, ggplot2, dplyr

Python: pandas, seaborn
