# Affordable-Housing-Chicago-Analysis

📌 Overview
This project analyzes Chicago's affordable rental housing developments using statistical and geospatial techniques. We explore property type distributions, community area trends, and spatial accessibility to inform urban planning and policy decisions.

🔍 Key Findings
Property Types:

Multifamily (44%) and ARO (25%) dominate the market.

Niche demographics (e.g., Senior LGBTQ, Supportive Veterans) show significant underrepresentation.

Geospatial Patterns:

Clusters of affordable housing identified in specific community areas.

Weak correlation between unit counts and property types.

Policy Insights:

Highlights gaps in housing for vulnerable populations.

Supports data-driven resource allocation strategies.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Languages: R (primary), Python

Libraries:

leaflet (interactive maps), ggplot2 (visualizations), dplyr (data wrangling).

pandas, seaborn (Python analysis).

Data Source: City of Chicago Dataset (593 rows × 14 columns).

📊 Methods
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and standardized formats.

Exploratory Analysis: Bar graphs, histograms, and heatmaps to compare property types and community densities.

Geospatial Analysis: Latitude/longitude coordinates mapped using Leaflet for spatial trend detection.
